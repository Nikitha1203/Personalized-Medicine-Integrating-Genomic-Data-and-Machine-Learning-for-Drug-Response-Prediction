Personalized Medicine: Integrating Genomic Data and Machine Learning for Drug Response Prediction


Project Overview
The "Personalized Medicine" project aims to leverage genomic data and machine learning techniques to predict drug responses at a personalized level. The project encompasses various components, including synthetic data generation, exploration of genomic data, training machine learning models, encryption of sensitive data, model integration using Flask, and model evaluation.

Project Structure
1. Data Files:
drug_response_data.csv: This CSV file contains information about drug responses for different patients.

ehr_data.csv: This file includes Electronic Health Record (EHR) data for patients.

encryption_key.key: A file containing the encryption key used to secure sensitive data.

genomic_data.csv: Genomic data for patients.

synthetic_data.csv: Synthetic data generated for training machine learning models.

2. Code Files:
encryption_module.py: This Python script defines the EncryptionModule class, responsible for encrypting and decrypting sensitive data.

model_integration.py: This script integrates the trained machine learning models with a Flask app to make predictions.

3. Jupyter Notebooks:
explore_genomic_data.ipynb: This Jupyter notebook provides an interactive environment to explore and analyze genomic data.

train_ml_models.ipynb: This notebook is dedicated to training machine learning models using synthetic data.

evaluate_model.ipynb: Use this notebook to evaluate the performance of the trained models.

Setup Instructions
Step 1: Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Nikitha1203/Personalized-Medicine.git
cd Personalized-Medicine
Step 2: Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd Personalized-Medicine
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 3: Data Generation
Generate synthetic data using the provided script:

bash
Copy code
python generate_synthetic_data.py
Step 4: Explore Genomic Data
Launch Jupyter notebook for detailed exploration of genomic data:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook explore_genomic_data.ipynb
Step 5: Train Machine Learning Models
Access the Jupyter notebook for model training:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook train_ml_models.ipynb
Step 6: Encryption and Integration
Run the model integration script, ensuring the correct path to the encryption key:

bash
Copy code
python model_integration.py
Step 7: Evaluate Model
Use the Jupyter notebook for in-depth evaluation of the trained models:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook evaluate_model.ipynb
Additional Notes
Replace '/path/to/encryption_key.key' in the code with the actual path to your encryption key file.

Ensure that all required data files (drug_response_data.csv, ehr_data.csv, genomic_data.csv, synthetic_data.csv) are present before running the scripts.

Security Considerations
Pay close attention to security considerations:

Properly handle and store encryption keys.

Implement access controls for sensitive data.

Consider additional security measures based on your specific use case.

Next Steps
Further customize and enhance the project:

Modify the integration code in model_integration.py based on your application requirements.

Experiment with different machine learning models and hyperparameters for improved predictions.

Consider deploying the Flask app for real-world use.
